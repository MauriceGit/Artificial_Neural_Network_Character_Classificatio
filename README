    - Jens Begemann, inf101419@fh-wedel.de

==================================

This project is about implementing and creating a neural network with the ability to classify characters.
The implementation is in Python and uses no external resources or libraries except numpy.
The final results are competitive to existing frameworks, such as Pybrain or others.

./docs  --> All documents regarding the task and boundary conditions.

./src   --> Complete sourcecode for this project.
        --> Artificial neural network with backpropation: ./src/ANN/ann_Nlayers_Real_Data.py
        --> You can test or run the program by just calling it with python!
        cd ./src/ANN/
        python ann_Nlayers_Real_Data.py
